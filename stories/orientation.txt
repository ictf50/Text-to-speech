This is a humorous story where the speaker explains the office policies, as well as gossip about the staff, to a new employee.
It is extremely easy to read as the sentences are short and without any overly difficult words.
Many working English learners will relate to it as it explains the absurdities (silly moments) of modern office life and how so little of it makes sense.
What Is Great About It: Modern workplaces often feel like theaters where we pretend to work rather than get actual work done.
The speaker exposes this reality that nobody will ever admit to.
He over-explains everything from the view out the office window to the intimate details of everyone’s life—from the overweight loner to the secret serial killer.
It talks about the things that go unsaid; how people at the office know about the deep secrets of our home life, but do not talk about it.
