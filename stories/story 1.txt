The old house on the edge of town had always been rumored to be haunted. People whispered about strange noises, flickering lights, and ghostly apparitions in the windows.
    One Halloween night, a group of teenagers dared each other to spend the night in the house. They laughed off the rumors, convinced that it was all just an urban legend.
    But as the night wore on, strange things began to happen. The floorboards creaked, the walls seemed to breathe, and an icy chill filled the air.
     As they huddled together in fear, they heard a sound that made their blood run cold: the unmistakable sound of children's laughter, coming from deep within the house.
    They followed the sound to a locked door in the basement, and one of the boys bravely picked the lock. Inside, they found a small room, filled with old toys and dusty furniture.
  But as they looked around, they realized with horror that the toys were moving on their own, and the furniture was rearranging itself.
    Suddenly, the door slammed shut behind them, and the room was plunged into darkness. The laughter grew louder, and the temperature dropped so low that their breath turned to mist.
   As they stumbled around in the dark, they realized that they were not alone. Something was in the room with them, something malevolent and hungry.
   And as the children's laughter turned to screams of terror, they knew that they would never escape the haunted house alive
