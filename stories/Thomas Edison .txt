Thomas Edison tried two thousand different materials in search of a filament for the light bulb.
When none worked satisfactorily, his assistant complained: “All our work is in vain. We have learned nothing.”
Edison replied very confidently, “Oh, we have come a long way and we have learned a lot.
We now know that there are two thousand elements which we cannot use to make a good light bulb.”
