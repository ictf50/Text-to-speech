In the back shop of a second-hand dealer, some old furniture was dusting, waiting to find a buyer. Among them were a round table with golden feet, a graceful Voltaire armchair, an old oak sideboard, a pretty Art Deco lamp, and a small chest of drawers with three drawers.
All of them had once had the honor of being displayed in a window. But faced with the little interest they aroused among its customers, the second-hand dealer had stored them one by one at the back of the store. And from then on, no one paid any attention to them.
- If it continues, said the Voltaire armchair, we will all end up devoured by mites!
- I am inedible, the lamp burned.
- Inedible perhaps, but surely oxidizable, retorted the table.
- I have squeaky doors, the buffet kept repeating.
The little dresser, on the other hand, never complained and paid little attention to the lamentation of the other furniture. Formerly, its pretty mahogany color and the elegance of its curve had attracted many eyes. But nevertheless, she never found a buyer.
Because the small dresser had a big flaw that put off all buyers: none of its drawers wanted to open. The second-hand dealer had attempted many repairs, but in vain ... the drawers, still, remained locked.
The little dresser quickly understood that no one would want to buy it because, finally! who would want a chest of drawers with locked drawers? She knew that she would have to spend the rest of her life at the bottom of this shop among the forgotten old furniture, so with dignity, she accepted her fate, resigned.
One summer day, a flirtatious, fragrant young lady entered the shop. - Hey guys! sniff me a little this perfume! launched the old sideboard, opening all its doors.
 Um! A feminine scent, replied the connoisseur Voltaire.
- All in place! cried the lamp. I see the lady approaching.
In an instant the furniture froze, offering their best angle to the visitor's gaze. The young lady approached the group of furniture and looked at them for a long time. Then to the junk dealer who was approaching:
- What era, this little dresser? she asked.
- Forget this chest of drawers, dear little lady! Itâ€™s not a big deal! None of its drawers open!
- What a pity ! In this case, I will take this small Art Deco lamp. Pack it nicely, it's for gift. And the lamp disappeared, carried away by the pretty lady towards a new destiny.
- Good riddance, threw the table dryly when everyone was gone.
- What was the best thing about this lamp? whined the Voltaire.
- Don't worry old! One day it will be your turn, reassured the old buffet.
And indeed, one rainy autumn day, the graceful Voltaire armchair in turn left the second-hand dealer shop, carried away by the muscular arms of a kind father. They installed him in a small Parisian living room, between the fireplace and the window, and every day, therefore, he sat down to rest with a large gutter cat, which he called Clement.
 Hi old man. whispered the old sideboard, watching the Voltaire move away to an unknown destiny.
- Good luck ! had launched the table.
And both of them had shed a few tears of furniture that had rolled to the ground in little sheep of dust. The little dresser, as usual, had remained silent. Silent she was still when, in the first days of spring, an old lady in a flowered hat ventured to the back of the store and, discovering the round table with golden feet, bought it on the spot.
 I live on rue du Moulin, said the old lady to the second-hand dealer. Be so kind as to deliver this little wonder to me before this evening.
So without further ado, the second-hand dealer lay the table with golden feet in the back of his truck and that same evening, she was sleeping in the dining room of the old lady in a flowered hat ... Her departure from the store was so hasty that she did not have time to say goodbye to the old sideboard which, in despair, dropped one of its doors.
There were other summers, rainy autumns, and still other springs, fragrant, flowery, or family patrons, but none of them ever wanted an old buffet without a door or a chest of drawers. locked drawers. The old buffet no longer complained, even if sometimes it felt a few small worms tickling its feet.
One night, while all the furniture was sleeping in the shop, he slipped painfully on his worm-eaten feet to the small chest of three drawers and said to him softly:
- I'm an old old buffet now, and my oak wood is very sick. I know that I will never know the warmth of a home again and that my life will end here, at the back of this shop. But you, little dresser, you so graceful under your mahogany dress, your future is elsewhere. You can still know the happiness of being useful to someone and this happiness cannot be refused. So make a little effort, and open your drawers.
Touched by the words of the old sideboard, for the first time, the little dresser decided to come out of her silence and in a small soft voice whispered:
- I will never open my drawers.
The old sideboard was so surprised to hear the little dresser speak that it dropped the last door it had left.
- But ... but ... he stuttered. You ... you ...
- I don't care how warm a home is, cut the little dresser. I feel good here.
- But why do you persist? exclaimed the buffet. What are you hiding in your drawers that you don't want us to find out?
- If I tell you what I'm hiding in it, won't you repeat it? asked the dresser, worried.
- I promise! Buffet word! I will not tell anything ! Never ! To no one !
The little dresser pressed against the old sideboard and whispered:
- My drawers are full of secrets!
- Secrets ! exclaimed the buffet in a breath.
- I hear them having fun and laughing, continued the little dresser They dance in circles in my drawers, do somersaults and crazy errands, and always have great stories to tell.
Stories that speak of the sun, flowers and distant countries. Stories that they came to hide in my drawers and that I am the only one to listen. They're all my treasure, and if I just open a drawer, they could fly away.
So I will be nothing more than a chest of drawers with three drawers, which we put in a living room or in a bedroom to store forks, sheets or old paper. I don't want this fate. I want to be, forever, the little chest of drawers with secrets.
- Oh ! dresser ! exclaimed the buffet. How I envy you to harbor these secrets! I have nothing inside but a few drafts and a lot of dust ... He let out a deep sigh and started to cry.
"Don't cry, buffet," begged the dresser, moved by the tears of the old furniture. Since now you know everything about me, I want to share my secrets with you. Dry your tears and hold yourself tight against me. Let us be silent and let the secrets come to whisper their beautiful stories to us.
At the far end of a second-hand store, somewhere, here or elsewhere, an old sideboard without doors and a small chest of drawers with locked drawers savor the passage of time by listening to stories of secrets.
